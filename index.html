        <p class="lead mb-4">About me: Hello everybody! My name is Ryan Haemin Jung, and I am currently a teacher at Sunshine Rests. A little about me is that I love to play soccer. I played soccer from the ages 4-18 and never regretted it since. Another sport that I did was skating. I was really good at skating for how long I did it. I would do all sorts of tricks off of stair sets and railings. Fun fact, I hit my head on the concrete while trying to ollie off of 9 stairs. I have a girl friend and she is amazing! I love to cook food, go to the gym, and watch TV! I own one dog and he is a pomeranian named benny. In the morning, Benny and I go on our daily walk to start off our day. I am an Asian American and am bilingual. I know the languages Korean and English. Through my efforts, I know that I can push anyone to become the greatest they can be. I am looking forward to teaching everybody here at Sunshine Rests, and till next time!<br><br>

        Teaching Experience: I have been teaching elementary and middle school children for 23 years now(About to be 24 in one month!)! Through communication and understanding each other we will learn how to optimize you to your full potential. My teaching consists of the subjects of math, english, and business. When I was younger, I would also tutor children at ZABA Elementary school and continued with my career of teaching. Every single day I read books to learn new contents and to know up to date information. I am a person who loves to push people to be the best they can be and I will make sure I do that. I also taught high school in my early years which helped me continue on my life and journey. Eventually I will be a professor at a university. Continue with me on our journey to learning material and content that is essential for later uses. <br><br>

        Future: In the future I want to be a professional at what I do. I hope to become a professor at the school University of California Riverside. I understand what I can do and eventually I will make it there. Through my hard work and consistency I know that I am the right candidate to further improve all of my students' status. Later on, I want to travel around the world visiting in places in the Asian territory. This is because I am Korean and want to experience more of the Asian cultures. I hope that I learn new content and become a better person than who I am right now. I want to be the smartest person alive. In the end of my journey I hope to find who I really am and what I want to do later in life.
